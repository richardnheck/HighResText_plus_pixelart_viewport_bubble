# HighResText_plus_pixelart_viewport_bubble
Godot example showing high resolution text with pixel art using viewport (animated example with speech bubble)

*This is not my own work.*  

I created this repository from code found at the "Download here" link below found on the page:
<https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/fd33b4/pixel_perfect_rendering_with_high_resolution_ui/>

>If you really want a pixel perfect game scene, as far as I know the "viewport stretch mode" plus "ViewportContainer+Viewport" is still the best option.
>If you instead go with 2D stretch mode, setting your scene up is much easier, but you also loose the pixel perfectness in your game scene.
>Just the other day I made this little demo for u/MungMoongYi in this discussion here.
>You can download the viewport version here, and the stretch mode 2D version here.
>I also made a *version with moving UI elements and pixel perfect rendering*, you can [download here](https://github.com/golddotasksquestions/zipdump/raw/master/HighResText_plus_pixelart_viewport_bubble.zip).
>I did not manage to add a camera and still keep the bubble at the player location though, maybe someone else can help with that. I would also like to know the solution. If you >don't need HD UI that moves with the player, adding a camera is no problem.
>You place the camera as child of the world instead of your character and tween to the player position or enable "smoothing", however this will most likely result in Sprite jitter >you can read up on it here. Apparently there has been a fix implemented but unfortunately it seems like it is scheduled for the 4.0 release and not the 3.2.1 maintenance release.
